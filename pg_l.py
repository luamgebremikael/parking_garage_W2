#Your parking gargage class should have the following methods:
# takeTicket
# This should decrease the amount of tickets available by 1
# This should decrease the amount of parkingSpaces available by 1
# payForParking
# Display an input that waits for an amount from the user and store it in a variable
 #If the payment variable is not empty then (meaning the ticket has been paid) -> display a message to the user that their ticket has been paid and they have 15mins to leave
# This should update the "currentTicket" dictionary key "paid" to True
#leaveGarage
 #If the ticket has been paid, display a message of "Thank You, have a nice day"
 #If the ticket has not been paid, display an input prompt for payment
 #Once paid, display message "Thank you, have a nice day!"
 #Update parkingSpaces list to increase by 1 (meaning add to the parkingSpaces list)
 #Update tickets list to increase by 1 (meaning add to the tickets list)

 #parkingSpaces -> list
 #currentTicket -> dictionary
